{"proteins": [{"id": "P08069", "protein_name": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor", "gene": "IGF1R_HUMAN", "function": "Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates actions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). Binds IGF1 with high affinity and IGF2 and insulin (INS) with a lower affinity. The activated IGF1R is involved in cell growth and survival control. IGF1R is crucial for tumor transformation and survival of malignant cell. Ligand binding activates the receptor kinase, leading to receptor autophosphorylation, and tyrosines phosphorylation of multiple substrates, that function as signaling adapter proteins including, the insulin-receptor substrates (IRS1/2), Shc and 14-3-3 proteins. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. The result of activating the MAPK pathway is increased cellular proliferation, whereas activating the PI3K pathway inhibits apoptosis and stimulates protein synthesis. Phosphorylated IRS1 can activate the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1), leading to activation of several downstream substrates, including protein AKT/PKB. AKT phosphorylation, in turn, enhances protein synthesis through mTOR activation and triggers the antiapoptotic effects of IGFIR through phosphorylation and inactivation of BAD. In parallel to PI3K-driven signaling, recruitment of Grb2/SOS by phosphorylated IRS1 or Shc leads to recruitment of Ras and activation of the ras-MAPK pathway. In addition to these two main signaling pathways IGF1R signals also through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway (JAK/STAT). Phosphorylation of JAK proteins can lead to phosphorylation/activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins. In particular activation of STAT3, may be essential for the transforming activity of IGF1R. The JAK/STAT pathway activates gene transcription and may be responsible for the transforming activity. JNK kinases can also be activated by the IGF1R. IGF1 exerts inhibiting activities on JNK activation via phosphorylation and inhibition of MAP3K5/ASK1, which is able to directly associate with the IGF1R", "pdb_entries": [["1IGR", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1IGR"], ["1JQH", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1JQH"], ["1K3A", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1K3A"], ["1M7N", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1M7N"], ["1P4O", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1P4O"], ["2OJ9", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/2OJ9"], ["2ZM3", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/2ZM3"], ["3D94", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3D94"], ["3F5P", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3F5P"], ["3I81", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3I81"], ["3LVP", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3LVP"], ["3LW0", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3LW0"], ["3NW5", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3NW5"], ["3NW6", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3NW6"], ["3NW7", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3NW7"], ["3O23", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3O23"], ["3QQU", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3QQU"], ["4D2R", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4D2R"], ["4XSS", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/4XSS"], ["5FXQ", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5FXQ"], ["5FXR", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5FXR"], ["5FXS", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5FXS"], ["5HZN", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5HZN"], ["5U8Q", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5U8Q"], ["5U8R", "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/5U8R"]], "gene_ontology": ["Alphav-Beta3 Integrin-Igf-1-Igf1R Complex", "Axon", "Insulin Receptor Complex", "Integral Component Of Plasma Membrane", "Intracellular Membrane-Bounded Organelle", "Membrane", "Plasma Membrane", "Receptor Complex", "Atp Binding", "Identical Protein Binding", "Insulin Binding", "Insulin Receptor Binding", "Insulin Receptor Substrate Binding", "Insulin-Activated Receptor Activity", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I Binding", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor-Activated Receptor Activity", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Binding", "Protein Tyrosine Kinase Activity", "Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase Activity", "Amyloid-Beta Clearance", "Anatomical Structure Development", "Cellular Response To Amyloid-Beta", "Cellular Response To Glucose Stimulus", "Dendritic Spine Maintenance", "Glucose Homeostasis", "Immune Response", "Inactivation Of Mapkk Activity", "Insulin Receptor Signaling Pathway", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor Receptor Signaling Pathway", "Negative Regulation Of Apoptotic Process", "Peptidyl-Tyrosine Autophosphorylation", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling", "Phosphatidylinositol-Mediated Signaling", "Positive Regulation Of Cell Migration", "Positive Regulation Of Cell Population Proliferation", "Positive Regulation Of Cold-Induced Thermogenesis", "Positive Regulation Of Mapk Cascade", "Positive Regulation Of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling", "Positive Regulation Of Protein Complex Disassembly", "Positive Regulation Of Protein Kinase B Signaling", "Protein Autophosphorylation", "Protein Tetramerization", "Regulation Of Jnk Cascade", "Signal Transduction", "Transmembrane Receptor Protein Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Pathway"]}]}
